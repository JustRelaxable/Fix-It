# Fix It!
Fix it is a game where your objective is the fixing props inside your house. After selecting a prop the player should find the glowed part of the broken prop. After the broken park has been found there is a scene where you drop glue to a shape for repairing that prop. The connection between filling the shape and repairing the object was weak so that is why i decided to not continue on this project.
